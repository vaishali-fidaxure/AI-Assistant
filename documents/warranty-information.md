**Last Updated: January 2025**

We stand behind the quality of our products. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary by state or country.

## One-Year Limited Warranty

All products purchased from our company are covered by a **one-year limited warranty** from the date of original purchase. This warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.

## What Is Covered

Our warranty covers:

- **Manufacturing defects**: Faults that existed at the time of manufacture
- **Material failures**: Defects in materials that prevent the product from functioning as intended
- **Workmanship issues**: Errors in assembly or construction that affect product performance

## What Is Not Covered

This warranty does not cover:

- **Normal wear and tear**: Expected deterioration from regular use over time
- **Accidental damage**: Drops, impacts, liquid damage, or misuse
- **Unauthorized repairs**: Damage caused by repair attempts by anyone other than our authorized service providers
- **Modifications**: Any alterations or modifications to the product
- **Commercial use**: Products used for commercial or rental purposes (unless otherwise specified)
- **Cosmetic damage**: Scratches, dents, or aesthetic issues that do not affect functionality
- **Consumables**: Batteries, bulbs, filters, and other replaceable parts (typically covered for 90 days)

## Warranty Claims Process

### Step 1: Gather Your Information

Before filing a claim, have the following ready:

- Original proof of purchase (receipt, order confirmation, or invoice)
- Product serial number (if applicable)
- Clear description of the issue
- Photos or video of the defect (if helpful)

### Step 2: Submit Your Claim

1. **Online**: Visit our warranty portal at support.company.com/warranty
2. **Email**: Send your claim to warranty@company.com
3. **Phone**: Call 1-800-555-0123 and select the warranty option

Include your order number, product details, and a description of the problem. Our warranty team will respond within 2 business days.

### Step 3: Evaluation

- We may request additional information or photos to assess your claim
- In some cases, we may ask you to ship the product to our service center for inspection (we provide a prepaid label)
- Evaluation typically takes 3-5 business days once we receive the product

### Step 4: Resolution

If your claim is approved, we will:

- **Repair**: Fix the product and return it to you
- **Replace**: Send a new unit of the same or equivalent product
- **Refund**: Issue a full refund if repair or replacement is not possible

Resolution time is typically 7-14 business days from claim approval.

## International Purchases

For orders shipped outside the United States, warranty coverage may vary. Please contact our international support team at international@company.com for region-specific warranty terms.

## Extended Warranty Options

We offer extended warranty plans (2-year or 3-year) at checkout for eligible products. Extended warranties provide additional coverage beyond the standard one-year period. Terms and pricing vary by product.

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, our liability under this warranty is limited to the purchase price of the product. We are not liable for incidental, consequential, or indirect damages arising from product use or failure.

## State Law Rights

Some states do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts or the exclusion of incidental damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may have other rights which vary from state to state.
